  summary:
    "I'm a Computer Science student at SUSTech (GPA 3.79/4.0) researching physics-informed machine learning, surgical vision, and data-driven decision systems. I currently develop multitemporal crop yield pipelines as a Mitacs & CSC funded research intern at McGill University and previously built analytics products at Wego Singapore showcased at WiT conferences in Dubai and Japan. My projects explore frontier intersections of AI and physical systems—from Wave-CDAnet, a physics-informed neural network for water wave super-resolution, to event-based depth estimation for ophthalmic surgery and biomimetic underwater robotics funded by municipal innovation grants.",
